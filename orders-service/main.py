"""Orders Service

This microservice exposes an endpoint for administrators to list all
completed orders. The data is read from the same JSON file written by
checkout-service. This service is readâ€‘only and does not modify the
orders file.

Endpoint:
    GET /api/orders â†’ returns a list of all orders

To run locally:
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8005
